## 🧩 Problem & Context

Raw job posting data arrives as flat CSV files in Google Cloud Storage—not structured for analytical queries. Analysts need to answer:

- Which skills are most in-demand over time?
- What are hiring trends by company and location?
- How do salary patterns vary by role and skill?

**Challenge:** Data teams need a single source of truth system—a data warehouse—to enable consistent, reliable analysis across the organization. Additionally, specialized data marts are required to optimize resources by pre-aggregating data for specific business use cases, reducing query complexity and improving performance for common analytical patterns.

**Solution:** End-to-end ETL pipeline that extracts CSVs from cloud storage, normalizes them into a star schema warehouse (separating facts from dimensions), and creates specialized data marts optimized for specific use cases (flat queries, skill demand analysis, priority role tracking).

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture


![Data Pipeline Architecture](Docs/DWH_Project_Overview.png)

The pipeline transforms job posting CSVs from Google Cloud Storage into a normalized star schema data warehouse, then builds specialized analytical data marts. BI tools (Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python) consume from both the warehouse and marts.

### Data Warehouse

The data warehouse implements a star schema with `company_dim`, `skills_dim`, `job_postings_fact`, and `skills_job_dim` tables.

![Data Warehouse Schema](Docs/ER_Diagram.png)

- **SQL Files:**
  - [`01_create_tables_in_DWH.sql`](./01_create_tables_in_DWH.sql) – Defines star schema with 4 core tables
  - [`02_load_data_into_DWH.sql`](./02_load_data_into_DWH.sql) – Extracts CSVs and loads into warehouse tables
  - [`03_data_validation_of_DWH.sql`](./03_data_validation_of_DWH.sql) – Make Data Validation checks on top of data warehouse.
- **Purpose:** Star schema serving as single source of truth for analytical queries
- **Grain:** One row per job posting in the fact table (`job_postings_fact`)

### Flat Mart

Denormalized table with all dimensions for ad-hoc queries.

![Flat Mart Schema](Docs/Flat_Mart.png)

- **SQL File:** [`04_create_flat_mart.sql`](./04_create_flat_mart.sql) – Builds denormalized table with all dimensions joined, [`05_data_validation_flat_mart.sql`](./05_data_validation_flat_mart.sql) – Perform Validation process of flat mart
- **Purpose:** Denormalized table for quick ad-hoc queries
- **Grain:** One row per job posting with all dimensions joined

### Skills Mart

Time-series skill demand analysis with additive measures.

![Skills Mart Schema](Docs/Skills_Mart.png)

- **SQL File:** [`06_create_skill_mart.sql`](./06_create_skill_mart.sql) – Builds time-series skill demand mart, [`07_data_validation_skill_mart.sql`](./07_data_validation_skill_mart.sql) – Perform Validatioin for Skill Mart Tables
- **Purpose:** Time-series analysis of skill demand over time with additive measures
- **Grain:** `skill_id + month_start_date + job_title_short`
- **Key Features:** All measures are additive (counts/sums) for safe re-aggregation

### Priority Mart

Priority role tracking with incremental updates using MERGE operations.

![Priority Mart Schema](Docs/Priority_Mart.png)

- **SQL Files:**
  - [`08_create_priority_mart.sql`](./08_create_priority_mart.sql) – Initial build of priority roles and jobs snapshot, 
  - [`09_update_priority_mart.sql`](./09_update_priority_mart.sql) – **Incremental update using MERGE**
  - [`10_data_validation_priority_mart.sql`](./10_data_validation_priority_mart.sql) - Validation of Tables efore and after update
- **Purpose:** Track priority roles and job snapshots with incremental update capabilities
- **Grain:** One row per job posting with priority level assignment
- **Key Features:** **MERGE operations for incremental updates** - demonstrates production-ready upsert patterns (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE in single statement)

### Company Mart

Company hiring trends by role, location, and month.

![Company Mart Schema](Docs/Company_Mart.png)

- **SQL File:** [`11_create_company_mart.sql`](./11_create_company_mart.sql) – Builds company hiring trends mart, [`12_data_validation_company_mart.sql`](./12_data_validation_company_mart.sql) – Perform Validation for Checking all Tables and Data
- **Purpose:** Company hiring trends analysis by role, location, and month
- **Grain:** `company_id + job_title_short_id + location_id + month_start_date`
- **Key Features:** Bridge tables for many-to-many relationships (company-location, job title hierarchies)

## 💻 Data Engineering Skills Demonstrated

### ETL Pipeline Development

- **Extract:** `CSV` Local Files Extract into Tables 
- **Transform:** Data normalization, type conversion (`CAST`, `DATE_TRUNC`), and quality filtering  
- **Load:** Idempotent table creation with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` patterns  
- **Incremental Updates:** MERGE operations for upsert patterns (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE in single statement)  
- **Orchestration:** Master SQL script (`build_dwh_and_marts.sql`) for automated pipeline execution  

### Dimensional Modeling

- **Star Schema Design:** Fact table (`job_postings_fact`) with dimension tables (`company_dim`, `skills_dim`)  
- **Bridge Tables:** Many-to-many relationship handling (`skills_job_dim`, `bridge_company_location`, `bridge_job_title`)  
- **Grain Definition:** Proper fact table granularity (skill+month, company+title+location+month)  
- **Additive Measures:** Counts and sums that can be safely re-aggregated at any level  
- **Surrogate Keys:** Sequential ID generation using CTEs



### SQL Advanced Techniques

- **DDL Operations:** `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE SCHEMA` for schema management  
- **DML Operations:** `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` with explicit column mapping from CSV sources  
- **MERGE Operations:** Incremental updates using `MERGE INTO` with `WHEN MATCHED`, `WHEN NOT MATCHED`, and `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE` clauses for production-ready upsert patterns  
- **CTEs:** Common Table Expressions for complex transformations and boolean flag conversions  
- **Date Functions:** `DATE_TRUNC('month')`, `EXTRACT(quarter)` for temporal dimension creation  
- **String Functions:** `STRING_AGG` for concatenation, `REPLACE` for data cleaning  
- **Boolean Logic:** `CASE WHEN` conversions for aggregating flags (remote, health insurance, no degree)  

### Data Quality & Production Practices

- **Idempotency:** All scripts safely rerunnable without side effects  
- **Data Validation:** Verification queries at each pipeline step to ensure data integrity  
- **Type Safety:** Proper data type definitions (`VARCHAR`, `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`, `TIMESTAMP`)  
- **Schema Organization:** Separate schemas (`flat_mart`, `skills_mart`, `priority_mart`, `company_mart`) for logical separation  
- **Error Handling:** Structured script execution with clear error messages and progress reporting
